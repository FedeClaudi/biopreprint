#+TITLE:    LaTeX Preprint Class for Biology Journals
#+AUTHOR:    Dan Meliza
#+EMAIL:     dan@meliza.org
#+LANGUAGE:   en

A LaTeX class and associated files for generating preprints for
journal submissions.  Many journals accept submissions directly in
LaTeX format and provide their own classes and styles for doing so. A
large majority of biology journals are not so obliging, but many
manuscripts submission systems will accept PDF files.  The journal may
ask for a document in some other format when the article is accepted,
but if the article needs to be shopped around (a rather high
probability in my world), reformatting a LaTeX
file is much, much easier.

The class is based around [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/nature/][the CTAN package nature]], written by Peter
Czoschke, using his NPG style bibliography and adding additional style
and bst files for other journals. My LaTeX hacking skills are rather
primitive and this should be considered as a general resource rather
than a fully-fledged package.  Assistance in further development is
certainly welcome.

* Instructions

The /preprint/ class contains many of the packages and options I
commonly use in writing a scientific manuscript.  Journal-specific
formatting is provided by a number of classes inheriting from
/preprint/.

If you're reading this document in Emacs in org-mode, you can use the
instructions to generate a template document by typing C-c C-v C-t or
executing the following command (type C-c C-c while in the code block)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
(org-babel-tangle)
#+end_src

** Preamble

The /preprint/ classes are based on /article/, so you can pass any
arguments in the documentclass command that you would to article.  Do
not use the /preprint/ class itself, but select one of the classes
specific to a journal or publishing group.

#+begin_src latex :tangle yes :exports code
  \documentclass[english]{neuron}
#+end_src

** Document

The /preprint/ class defines a number of environments that can be used
to format the front page, abstract, and other sections that often have
variant names.

*** Affiliations

The affiliations environment is a special list that prefixes each item
with a superscript number.  Add superscript numbers to the author command
corresponding to each affliation.  To suppress numbering for an item supply an
empty optional argument.

#+begin_src latex :tangle yes :exports code
  \title{Auditory processing in the avian forebrain}
  \author{C Daniel Meliza\textsuperscript{1} \& Distinguished Mentor\textsuperscript{1,2}}

  \begin{document}
  \maketitle
  \begin{affiliations}
  \item Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy
  \item Department of Psychology
  \item[] University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60647, USA
  \end{affiliations}

#+end_src

*** Front matter

Front matter can include running titles, corresponding author,
acknowledgements, etc.  The frontpage environment is a simple
single-spaced list.

#+begin_src latex :tangle yes :exports code
  \begin{frontpage}
    \item[Running title:] Cortical processing in avian forebrain
    \item[Corresponding Author:] ~\\
  C. Daniel Meliza\\
  Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy\\
  The University of Chicago\\
  1027 E 57th Street\\
  Chicago, IL 60647, USA\\
  Ph. (773) 702-8090\\
  Fax (773) 702-0037\\
  \end{frontpage}

#+end_src

*** Sections

Each of the standard sections of a paper (Abstract, Introduction,
Methods, Results, Discussion) have a corresponding environment.  This
allows the style files to control formatting and title according to
the journal's style.

Note, however, that the ordering of the sections is not defined by
the style, but by their actual order in the text, so some
rearrangement may be necessary.

#+begin_src latex :tangle yes :exports code
  \begin{abstract}
    May have a heading, and could be boldface
  \end{abstract}

  \begin{introduction}
    May have a heading

    \subsection{Introductory subsection}
    Subsection titles may be allowed

  \end{introduction}

  \begin{methods}
    May be called any number of things
  \end{methods}

  \begin{results}
    The most straightforward section
  \end{results}

  \begin{discussion}
    May be titled differently
    \subsection{Discussion subsection}
    Discussion subsections may be allowed
  \end{discussion}

  \paragraph{Acknowledgements}  This section may need to go in the front
  matter, which is up to the user.

#+end_src

*** References

Citations and reference lists are handled with [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/][natbib]].  Use the \citep
command for most citations and /preprint/ will select the correct
format (author-date, superscript or parenthetical numbers).  Some
manual adjustment may be necessary when part of the citation goes in
the text; e.g. "the striking work by Meliza et al. (2006)".

#+begin_src latex :tangle yes :exports code
  % The \references command creates section heading if needed, and
  % clears the page if needed
  \references{mybibliography}

#+end_src

**** TODO Suppress subsection headings in formats that do not allow them.

*** Figures

Figures are generally submitted separately from the document text, so
/preprint/ suppresses any includegraphics commands.  Two options for
including figure legends are supported.  One is to use normal figure
float environments at any point in the text, followed by a
\listoffigures command where the legends should appear.  The other is
to use unfloated \includegraphics commands followed by
\captionof{figure}.  The latter is a bit more flexible.

Additional control can be obtained with the /subfig/ package.

#+begin_src latex :tangle yes :exports code  \begin{figure}
  \begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{MyFigure}
  \caption{ Cumulative Response Distributions\newline
  Note that the usual double-slash does not insert a newline in the caption.}
  \label{fig:response-dist}
  \end{figure}

  \listoffigures
  \end{document}
#+end_src

* Supported Formats

The following formats are current as of May 2011.

** Nature Neuroscience (and probably other NPG journals): natneurosci.cls

   Superscript citations, untitled Introduction.  Figure Legends
   should come between Acknowledgements and Methods.

** Neuron (and probably other Cell Press journals): neuron.cls

   Author-date citations, abstract called Summary, methods called
   Experimental Procedures.  Adds an environment called highlights
   which is a list of main findings that should follow the Summary

** Journal of Neuroscience: jneurosci.cls

   Author-date citations, methods called Materials and Methods.
   Journal requires quite a bit of front matter.

** TODO Journal of Neurophysiology
